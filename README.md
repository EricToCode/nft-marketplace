Supplemental Idea:

use the blockchain as a method to authenticate a user to gain access to data
for example: proof of work or transaction on the blockchain as password unlocking access to a video file

README (AS IFT 6056 PROJECT):

An NFT-based authentication marketplace for selling rare/collector items
The idea is to use NFTs to authenticate products sold on the platform.
An additional idea is to use a blockchain (custom or existing such as ethereum platform) to authenticate user access to private data.

CURRENT PROGRESS:

minting feature done
need to implement buyer offer / seller accept transaction
